# Getting started

I´m going to supose that all the concepts related with node.js are known if you are reading this tutorial so if i miss some explanation just get a try to Google ;-).

To get started just follow this steps:

## Initializatin the project
We have create a git project and clone the repo and inside the folder ´/telegram-broker´ we are going to create a folder

```
mkdir src
```

Inside this repo we are going to init the node project using npm so just:

```
npm init
```

After filling some fields like the project name, license... finally we will get a "virgin" file ´package.json´, we will start with this.
