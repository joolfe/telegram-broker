# Comunicating with Telegram

Let's start testing the library, just to remember we are going to give a try to this one [telegram-mtproto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram-mtproto), so first step is to install the dependency using npm like this:

```
npm install --save telegram-mtproto@2.2.8
```

Now we can start using the library, at first stage we will start soing all our code and test in the `index.js` file, we will refactor or create modules in the future when the application start growing.
