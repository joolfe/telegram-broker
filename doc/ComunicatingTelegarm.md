# Comunicating with Telegram

Let's start testing the library, just to remember we are going to give a try to this one [telegram-mtproto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram-mtproto), so first step is to install the dependency using npm like this:

```
npm install --save telegram-mtproto@3.0.6
```

Now we can start using the library, at first stage we will start doing all our code in the `index.js` file and just executing the app as a script, we will refactor and create modules in the future when the application start growing...

## Initializing the client

Having a look to the library docs (I'm afraid the doc is very poor :-() and more concretely to the examples we see that instanciation of `MTProto` client need some configuration objects, the configuration data provided by telegram while registering the application (`api_id` and `api_hash`) and also some technical data like the layer, initConnection... in our code we can create the next object and then instanciate the client like this:

```{js}
const app = {
  app_hash: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  api_id: XXXXX
}

const api = {
  layer          : 57,
  initConnection : 0x69796de9,
  api_id         : app.api_id
}

const server = {
  dev: true 
}

const client = MTProto({ server, api })

console.log("We are running!");
```

The fields thats appear as sequences of 'X' character are secret fields, we don't want to hardcode this value in our code because will be commit and push to the git repo that can be public like our case so we need a different solution to store this values, for example, having this values in a `config.json` file deliver in the same problem because we need to store this file in some where... for now what we are going to do is a easy solution, this secret values will be read from an environment variable so is a runtime dependency to have this avlues initialized.

Let's create two environment variables with the values with the names `API_ID` and `API_HASH`, in mac is as easy as execute this commands in the terminal:

```
$ export API_ID=80XXXX
$ export API_HASH=xXxXxXxXxXxXxX7793638b2d97
```

To check that variables are correctly setup we can execute a `printenv` command and will see all the environment variables :-).

Well now is time for read environment variables from nodejs code, fortunately is as easy as use `process.env.{variale_name}` so in our code we replace the `app` object definition by:

```
const app = {
  app_hash: process.env.API_HASH,
  api_id: parseInt(process.env.API_ID)
}
```

Note that we should parse the `API_ID` field to int because is waht MTproto expect.

Now it's time to test, if we run `npm start` we should see our wellcome message and no errors.

## Authorization flow

Well we have created a telegram client, not too impressive because we have not really communicate yet, to start the communication with telegram we need first to authenticate, and we will follow this [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/api/auth) for it.

Because we are not going to use the Bot API (remember the reasons in the "telegarm API" page) to authenticate we need a User credential, this is just a real Phone number and a code that is sent via Telegram or SMS to validate this phone.

So the authentication that we are going to implement has two steps, first we will request a method `auth.sendCode` and when we recieve the code in the phone we will use the method `auth.signIn` to login. As result our telegram client is logged in and can execute API calls with a logged session.

So as first step we are going to create a way to ask the validation code from the program, this code is a variable value and we cannot hardcode in the code or in a config file, as temporal solution we can use the console as input, we will improve this in the future... So lets create a function that do this job but for make it easier let us use a library 

```
$ npm install --save readline
```

Also we need to define a `phone` variable to hold the phone number, again because this is a sensitive field we are going to store the phone number in a environment variable (I don't want telephone spam because i upload some code to github :-P), now that we start having lot of environment variables you can see this this [trick](Improving environment varibale setup)  

So this is the code that we add into the `index.js` file:
 
```
const phone_number = process.env.PHONE_NUMBER

const askForCode = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const rl = readline.createInterface({
      input : process.stdin,
      output: process.stdout
    });

    rl.question('Please enter passcode for ' + phone_number + ':\n', (num) => {
      rl.close();
      resolve(num);
    });
  })
};

```

To test this code we can create a async function to call the method, like this:


```
(async function() {
  console.log("We are running!");

  let code = await askForCode();

  console.log("And the code is: " + code);
})();
```

Then if we run the program with a `$ npm start` we should see something like

```
We are running!
Please enter passcode for +34XXXXXX:
45678 // This have been entered by me manually 
And the code is: 45678
```

Ok now we have all the tools to do the authorization flow, to use the MTProto client is very easy, we just need to call the `client()` function using as first parameter a string that represent the method name like `auth.sendCode` and as second parameter a JSON object containing all the input params, the return value of this function is a Promise so we can consume using an `await` or a `then()` funtion. 

We are going to put all the authorization code inside a function `connect()`, let us see the code and then we can analize:

```
async function connect(){

  const { phone_code_hash } = await client('auth.sendCode', {
    phone_number  : phone_number,
    current_number: false,
    api_id        : app_cfg.api_id,
    api_hash      : app_cfg.api_hash
  })

  console.log('Wow we get something? ', phone_code_hash)

  let phone_code = await askForCode();

  console.log('We have the phone code:', phone_number);

  const { user } = await client('auth.signIn', {
    phone_number   : phone_number,
    phone_code_hash: phone_code_hash,
    phone_code     : phone_code
  })

  console.log('Wow we are signed as ', user)

}
```

Basically as we already mention we are doing two calls using the telegram `client`, first to the `auth.sendCode` MTproto method using the api config params and the phone number, then we wait for the user input using our recently created method `askForCode()` and when we have the code we call to `auth.signIn` MTproto method using the phone code, phone number and a `phone_code_hash` that have been returned in the first MTproto call (for trazability and security i supose), if we have use the correct data at the end we are logged into telegram! :-)

To test our new funtion we can change a little our code ike this:

```
(async function() {
  console.log("We are running!");

  await connect();

  console.log("And now we are running!");
})();
```

And just use `$ npm start` as usual.

## Avoid login again and again...

We have progress a lot in our app but if you test the app a few times you will realize that each time we should introduce a code, not too util... for avoid this MTProto use sessions, for example if you are using telegram in your mobile device you don't have to authenticate all the times that you open the app, this is because the telegram session is stored locally in your phone and the app use this to comunicate.

Fortunately telegram-mtproto library comes with builtin support for storage session, we can implement a storage solution but the easiest way to use this feature is using the library `mtproto-storage-fs`. 
Use this library cannot be easier, first install using `$ npm install --save 'mtproto-storage-fs` then we can import in our `index.js`, initialize a `Storage` object and pass this parameter to our telegram client instantiation, just this code:

```
const { Storage } = require('mtproto-storage-fs');

const app = {
  storage: new Storage('./session.json')
};

const client = MTProto({ server, api, app });
```

With this code the telegram session will be store in a `session.js` file, but if you test the app now still the verification code is required in each execution, this is because the `telegram-mtproto` doesnÂ´t has the logic to check if the session exist and avoid ask again for authentication so let us create this logic in our app:

```
async function connect(){

  if (!(await app.storage.get('signedin'))) {
    console.log('Not signed in');
    await authorize();
    console.log('Signed in successfully');
    app.storage.set('signedin', true);
  } else {
    console.log('Already signed in');
  }
  
}
```

First we have done a little refactor so our old method `connect()` now is called `authorize()`, that have more sense, and now we have create a new `connect()` function that contains the logic for only ask for authentictaion is needed, if you see the code is very clear, we just store a key in our `Storage` object that say the user is already signedin.
You can test now and see that first time code is asked but the next time you are already signed in. cool!

> Telegarm Layers: The way that Telegram use for verison the API is claled Layers, when they change the "schema" of the API they release a new layer, in the example of the library the layer number 57 is used but there are several new ones, there exist a pretty web to see the new TL-schemas here https://schema.horner.tj/#!/
