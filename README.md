Testing telegram API with a real use case.

See the /docs folder for more info, this repo is going to be explained step by step in the doc.


# Ideas/Todo
- We should decide if we should do some kind of pooling or we can subcribe to channel changes.
- Look for a way to get just recent messages, i mean, we are not interested in old message, some kind of date filter?
- We probabily need to store in somewhere the activity log so we can look for a good way to see this.
- Some UI interface will be needed.
- Documentations about user guide.
